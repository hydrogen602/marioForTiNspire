# marioForTiNspire

A mario-style game for the Ti-nspire CX using lua.
This game was only inspired by mario bros, but otherwise has nothing to do with that game.

The code only features three levels, but it has an editor mode that helps with creating new levels.  
It can be accessed by pressing 'c' while running it on the desktop version of the Ti-nspire CX.
Varies keys place different items, and the arrow keys move/resize them. Press 'p' to print out the final list of items, which can be copied and pasted into the code to add the new level.
